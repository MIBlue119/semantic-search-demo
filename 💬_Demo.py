    ### How it Works

    The bot takes Product titles and Descriptions from the Amazon India Product 
    Dataset and collates their content into a natural language search and a Conversation tool.

    Ask product related questions like **"Suggest some christmas gift ideas"** or **"What should I buy for
    my 10 year old brother?"**, or **"I'm looking for organic products"** and it returns relevant results!
    
    The app is powered using OpenAI's embedding service with Pinecone's vector database. The whole process consists
    of *three* steps:
    
    **1**. User Queries are fed into OpenAI's embeddings service to generate a {'4096'}-dimensional query vector.
    
    **2**. We use Pinecone to identify similar context vectors (previously encoded from the Amazon Dataset).

    **3**. Relevant contexts are passed in a new question to OpenAI's generative model, returning our answer.

    **How do I make something like this?**

    It's easy! Book a [free Discovery Call with me](https://calendly.com/amagastya/15min) and I'll get your bot setup in no-time!
